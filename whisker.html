            A student named Miyo Sasaki is in the second grade of junior high school. In her daily life at school, her friends call her Muge. In her class, Muge falls in love with one of her classmates in class, his named Kento Honode. Muge always approached Kento in many ways. However, Kento, who has a cold personality, always ignores, and doesn't care. Kento also doesn't care about Muge's efforts. Muge decides to use the magic mask she found. The mask can turn her into a cat. Muge put on a mask and turned into a cute little white cat. This made Muge succeed in approaching Kento. Kento welcomes Muge in the form of a cat. Muge in the form of a cat is getting closer to Kento and knows that Kento actually has family problems. It seems that problem is what makes Kento a cold person. He wanted to tell Muge about his problems while in cat form. Now, Muge seems afraid of losing that closeness if he enters Kento's life in her true form. So, Muge doesn't want to turn back into a human because when she becomes a cat she can be free to be close to Kento.
