            Since heavy rains hit the entire city of Tokyo, there people who choose to live in a bubble. A guy named Hibiki, he and his parkour team, Blue Blaze, compete over food for a month. Hibiki doesn't mix well between teams during competitions, but has very sensitive hearing. He heard a mysterious singing voice that only he could hear until Hibiki grew up.
            Hibiki had an accident while climbing the middle tower because of his curiosity about Tower Song. He fell and almost died, but Hibiki was saved by Uta. Uta learns how humans live. Because she is good at parkour, Uta becomes a part of Blue Blaze. The weakness is not being able to touch Hibiki. If that happens, the part of the body will return to a bubble. Since Uta was around, Hibiki is no longer an introvert. He began to find his identity and more open to others. Hibiki finds herself attracted to Uta. Likewise, Uta who has liked Hibiki since their first meeting.
