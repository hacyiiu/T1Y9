            Sulli is a singer, acting artist from South Korea, and a former member of the group f(x). She suffered from severe depression which led to suicide, and was found hanging on the 2nd floor of her house by her manager. Sulli suffers from panic attacks and social phobia, she often receives negative comments from fans because of her posts on Instagram. The haters of her fans started when Sulli's relationship with Choiza began to be exposed. The couple Sulli and Choiza were the most popular celebrity couple in the Korean entertainment industry back then. Even though they broke up in 2017, Sulli is known to have received a lot of criticism from this relationship. This criticism was not without reason, Choiza considered that Sulli's big fans had taken Sulli from their hearts. Not only that, Sulli has also been under a lot of pressure since joining as a trainee at SM Entertainment. As a result, she decided to take a break due to physical and mental exhaustion in 2017. In January 2019, in an interview, Sulli was seen crying because she thought that many people looked at her negatively.
