They communicate and become best friends and transfer to high school together. Chaeri is very beautiful, she is offered to enter a special club for beautiful people. But Chaeri didn't want to because Onyu wasn't invited. The fox club member allows Onyu to also join the club. Back then, the fox club was very peaceful and always together, but after Chaeri and Onyu entered, everything changed. The club captain is Kim Ilmi, has a bestfriend named Han Huiseung since junior high school. Huiseung was interested in Chaeri, they became close because they often talked and finally dating. Ilmi disliked and took revenge on both of them by approaching them and betray them. Ilmi was a trainee at a management company because she wanted to become an idol.
