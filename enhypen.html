            On May 26, 2021, a member of K-pop group Enhypen was accused of saying the N-word while singing along to SZA's "Love Galore" in a video published on the group's official YouTube channel. This led to racist abuse within the fandom. It all started when K-pop group Enhypen uploaded a behind-the-scenes video of its members during a performance. In one part of the video, member Jake is shown singing "Love Galore" in the background. Some fans claim they can hear one of the members, it's not clear who, singing along and singing the N word. Black fans were disappointed to see the debate which turned out to be racist and violent. They said seeing the post gave him a lot of stress, feeling left out and disappointed that the group's label did nothing to this situation. There are now group chats where Black Engenes organizes ways to raise awareness about racism issues within their fandom, including planning hashtags and writing email templates. Fans have used the hashtag #ProtectBlackEngenes. Several people told that despite a lot of abuse from fans, they didn't want Enhypen to get hurt.
